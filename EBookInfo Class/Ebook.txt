Title: Calculus Made Easy
Author: Silvanus P. Thompson

Calculus is the mathematics of change.
It deals with quantities that vary and the rates at which they vary.

This book introduces the core ideas of differentiation and integration
in a way that’s meant to be simple and intuitive.
Each chapter builds upon the previous one, using practical examples
to show how calculus connects to real-life problems.

Remember: don’t be afraid of symbols—they’re just shorthand for ideas.
Once you grasp the ideas, the symbols start to make sense too.
